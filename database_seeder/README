# Predict.py Instructions

## Overview
The `predict.py` file is a Python script designed to perform predictions based on a pre-trained machine learning model. It processes input data, applies the model, and outputs the prediction results.

## Features
- Loads a pre-trained model.
- Accepts input data (e.g., images, videos, or structured data).
- Processes the input data for compatibility with the model.
- Outputs predictions in a user-friendly format.

## Usage
1. **Ensure Dependencies are Installed**  
    Make sure all required dependencies are installed. You can find the list of dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Prepare Input Data**  
    Place the input data (e.g., images or videos) in the appropriate directory or provide the path as an argument when running the script.

3. **Run the Script**  
    Execute the script using the following command:
    ```
    python predict.py --input <path_to_input_data> --output <path_to_output>
    ```
    Replace `<path_to_input_data>` with the path to your input data and `<path_to_output>` with the desired output directory.

4. **View Results**  
    The predictions will be saved in the specified output directory or displayed in the terminal, depending on the implementation.

## Example
